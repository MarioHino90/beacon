# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## 1. Why do I have to use `npm login` instead of `yarn login`?

Per the [`yarn login` documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/login/):

> Running this command will prompt you for your username and email for the npm registry. It will **not** ask for your password.
> Later when you run a command that requires authentication such as yarn publish, you will have to enter your password to do so.

However, our use case requires the password to be entered when logging in to gain access to private repositories, which is a
feature `NPM` offers. As a result, the login step must be performed via `npm login`. `yarn` later uses this login information
when you run commands like `yarn` or `yarn add`.

## 2. Why did you choose `yarn` over `npm`?

There are many benefits of `yarn` over `npm` that specifically work for the Beacon repository use case and more generally.

The most significant reason we chose `yarn` was because it offers a feature called [`workspaces`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/),
which allows projects with multiple packages (like Beacon, which is a monorepo that uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna))
to link and install all the dependencies together at the root level of the project. This allows `yarn` to better optimize
dependency management, generate a single `yarn.lock` file at the root, install most external dependencies at a root-level
`node_modules`, and allow developers to make changes to the various packages and immediately have access to those changes
without having to muck around with things like `yarn link`.

Additionally, `yarn` has other smaller benefits over `npm`, such as:

- Better caching that results in faster reinstalls (try running `npm install` 3 times; now do `yarn` 3 times-- sweet, right?),
  which is useful when switching between branches with different dependencies
- Autocleaning that allows for the automatic deletion of sub-dependencies you may not _actually_ need via the `.yarnclean`
  file (case in point: `@types/react-native` is a dependency of `@types/styled-components` but is known to cause issues in
  web React projects; so `.yarnclean` allows us to automatically get rid of it after every installation)
- Pinned version resolutions, which can make working with sub-dependencies easier, especially if certain dependencies are not
  maintained as frequently

## 3. How can I contribute and/or propose new components or ideas?

Check out our <LinkTo kind="welcome-contributing-overview--page">contribution overview</LinkTo> to learn all about the
different ways to contribute.

## 4. When do lab components move to the core library?

When Dashboard Infrastructure engineers feel confident on the state and performance of Lab components, they are then moved
to Core.

## 5. How does Beacon handle versioning?

Beacon uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/), which is a standard used to communicate what kinds of changes are in a release.

When changes are made to Platform by DASHI engineers, teams who are impacted are tagged to review the pull request.

Changes made outside of Platform (e.g. Beacon) must be manually pulled into Platform via package upgrades through NPM so
that Engineers and teams can decide when to upgrade to the new version. We encourage teams to stay as up-to-date as possible.

## 6. How often do you review component, pattern, or workflow requests?

We review new Beacon requests and move them into a Jira backlog once a month. At that point they will go through a
research process to gather more information and be vetted.

## 7. How can I track the status of a request?

If you have submitted a request, we will tag you on the Jira ticket so you can be notified of updates to your request.

## 8. How does Beacon handle breaking changes and deprecation?

Beacon uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/), which is a standard used to communicate what kinds of changes are in a release.
If any Beacon component has a breaking change, it increases the major version of affected package(s) so that an Eng team
can see if it might break their code. The changelog for the package that had a major version bump will also specifically
reflect the nature of the breaking change and how to address it. This practice is followed in all DASHI-owned repositories,
including Beacon and Beacon Labs.

If a Beacon update does NOT include a major version bump, then you can be sure the new version of Beacon is compatible with
the version currently installed in your project.

## 9. Who works on the Beacon Product System?

Beacon has a core team of designers and developers who are dedicated to building and supporting the system.

The core team includes:

- Nick Willett-Jeffries - Director of Engineering
- Bill Abresch - Engineering Manager
- Dan Garrett - Senior Software Engineer
- Greg Beaver - Senior Software Engineer
- Hal Anil - Senior Software Engineer
- Samantha Abbott - Senior Software Engineer
- Nick Robin - Interim Product Manager
- Melissa Haworth - Senior Product Design Manager
- Jucelle Lim - Senior Product Designer

## 10. What’s on the roadmap?

See the <LinkTo kind="welcome-status-and-roadmap">Roadmap</LinkTo> page for up to date plans.

## 11. What browsers are supported?

Beacon components are supported in all of the browsers Braze’s officially supports as noted on
[Confluence here](https://confluence.braze.com/display/DASHINFRA/Dashboard+Browser+Support+Guidelines)
and which include:

- Chrome (version 58 or newer)
- Firefox (version 54 or newer)
- Safari (version 10.1 or newer)
- Edge (any version)

## 12. What’s the best way to confirm if Beacon issues are known bugs or not?

To check if a bug is known, view the [Beacon Jira bug backlog](https://jira.braze.com/browse/DASHI-1085?jql=project%20%3D%20%22Dashboard%20Infrastructure%22%20AND%20type%20%3D%20Bug%20).

If you have a bug to report or are not sure, please submit it to the [PBUG reporter](https://pbug.braze.com).

You can also reach out to us on [#product-dash-infra-team](https://brazetechnology.slack.com/archives/C01145XABT9).

## 13. When does Beacon release merged code?

Beacon has a build time of ~30-45 minutes and is released to NPM immediately after the code is merged.
Any changes are also simultaneously reflected on the Beacon Storybook.

## 14. Why build our own Design System instead of utilizing existing libraries like Material UI?

The ability to customize components to our needs and cater to the complexity of the Braze product is the primary
reason we decided to build our own design system. Furthermore, whitelabeling an existing library can cause maintenance
and scalability issues especially as we evolve the components and mold them to our specific use cases.

## 15. What goes into Beacon’s component library vs Platform’s component library?

Beacon’s component library follows our Beacon Criteria [Link to our Contribution page] and is unique, reusable, and agnostic
to the product. These are self contained components that do not contain any business logic which you would find on the Platform’s
component library.

While the largest user of Beacon is Platform, Beacon can and is also used in various projects across Braze, including PBUG,
Webinole, and more!
