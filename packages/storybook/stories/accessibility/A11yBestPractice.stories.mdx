# A11y Best Practices

There are broad best practices to keep in mind while designing and developing for different a11y user types that can go a long way towards creating accessible products listed below.

For a more in-depth checklist to reference, we recommend using the
[A11y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/).

### Blind

Blind individuals have loss of vision in both eyes that is uncorrectable. With blindness, vision impairment is significant enough that one cannot function without personal or technological assistance due to the extreme loss of visible clarity.

> An estimated .6 % of the world’s population are blind, ~49 million

#### Hurdles

- Cannot use a pointer or a mouse
- Rely on screen readers to take in content

#### Best Practices

- Use accessible heading styles
- Use descriptive hyperlinks and buttons
- Ensure visual information translates into text and use alt text for images
- Clearly define information in metadata for screen readers
- Use a linear logical layout
- Follow [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/)

<br />

### Low Vision

Low vision individuals have the ability to see colors, but may struggle with the following: tunnel vision; central field loss; clouded vision; ability to only see the middle or only the edge of the field of vision.

> An estimated 2.8% of the world’s population have low vision, ~221 million

#### Hurdles

- Designs may break when browser font size is increased too much
- Often need access to high-contrast modes
- Often need to use monochrome displays

#### Best Practices

- Maximize readability and clarity of content
- Allow manual font size adjustments
- Ensure there is enough color contrast between text/background
- Use a readable font size
- Limit and prioritize color in the interface
- Don’t rely on color alone to communicate important information
- Consider using texture to help with contrast
- Use a linear logical layout that can be easily magnified
- Follow [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/)

<br />

### Color Blind

Color blind individuals have difficulty distinguishing between colors such as red and green or yellow and blue, and sometimes don’t have the ability to perceive any color whatsoever.

> An estimated 3.8% of the world’s population are color blind. ~300 million

#### Hurdles

- Cannot differentiate between some colors
- Rely on non-color information to use interface

#### Best Practices

- Avoid relying on color alone to convey information
- Use colors with symbols and text explanations
- Limit the color palette
- Consider using texture in addition to color to show emphasis

<br />

### Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing

Deaf individuals have little or no functional hearing. Hard of hearing individuals have hearing loss where there is residual hearing that can be assisted by an auditory device such as a hearing aid or FM system to help process speech.

> An estimated 6% of the world’s population have disabling hearing loss. ~466 million

#### Hurdles

- Rely on closed captioning and other audio representation

#### Best Practices

- Display information as text as well as audio
- Transcribe and caption all videos
- Synchronize captions
- Provide a summary of audio and video content
- Simplify navigation
- Use clear to the point copy
- Use a linear logical layout

<br />

### Physical

Physically impaired individuals have weakness and limitations of muscular control. Examples include: involuntary movements (tremors), lack of coordination, paralysis, limitations of sensation, joint disorders such as arthritis, pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs.

> An estimated 15% of the world's population have a significant physical or mental disability. ~785 million

#### Hurdles

- May not be able to use a keyboard, mouse or pointer
- May rely on voice recognition software

#### Best Practices

- Design for keyboard interaction
- Make large clickable actions
- Give clickable elements space
- Design with touch screen and mobile in mind
- Ensure tasks can be handled through voice commands
- Ensure tasks don’t require more than one hand to complete (mouse + hot a button on keyboard)
- Follow [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/)

<br />

### Cognitive

Cognitively impaired individuals can have a broad range of disabilities, from intellectual disabilities to age-related issues with thinking and remembering. The range includes people with mental illnesses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and includes people with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

> An estimated 15% of the world's population have a significant physical or mental disability. ~785 million

#### Hurdles

- May have difficulty understanding content
- May have a hard time remembering how to complete tasks
- May have confusion caused by inconsistent or non-traditional web page layouts

#### Best Practices

- Provide consistent layout, navigation, patterns, and clear page hierarchy
- Provide different ways to understand the content by delivering it in more than one way
- Help users understand with clear to the point copy and images
- Ensure processes do not rely on memory
- Highlight important content and areas that require attention
- Minimize distractions and provide focus
- Divide complex processes into logical essential steps with progress indicators
- Make forms easy to fill out with clear error guidance
- Provide enough time to complete tasks
- Steer clear of blinking, scrolling, or auto updating content
