# Accessibility & Inclusion
At Braze, we believe in creating great user experiences that are usable, accessible, and inclusive to as many people as possible. 

Accessibility enables people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and easily contribute to the web. 

We know we have a lot of work to do to make our product more accessible and inclusive, and as a first step, weâ€™re looking into [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) to understand the diverse range of visual, auditory, physical, and cognitive abilities our users may possess and what to keep in mind while designing for them. 


## How to use this guide

Beacon currently has some component-level [accessibility checks](https://medium.com/storybookjs/instant-accessibility-qa-linting-in-storybook-4a474b0f5347) in place (but not all) within Storybook. Our aim is to eventually do an accessibility audit on our entire product and fix accessibility issues. 

In the meantime, this guide is intended to help bridge the gap and serve as a high level overview of accessibility best practices for the entire Product, Design, & Engineering organization at Braze to use when designing and developing our product. 

**Accessibility Guide:**

2. <LinkTo kind="welcome-accessibility-checklists-tools--page">Checklists & Tools</LinkTo> provides external links with in-depth information on accessibility as well as tools and plugins to help incorporate accessibility into your workflow.

For an in-depth checklist to reference, we recommend using the [A11y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/).
