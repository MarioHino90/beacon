| Suited for marketing material, Braze brand & content copy paints the strengths of the company to prospective and existing customers.   | Meant to be as informative as possible, documentation copy explains how the platform works from a holistic POV. Think of a patient and informative professor.                                                                                | Similar to documentation copy, product copy is meant to be as informative as possible. Unlike documentation copy, product copy is localized to the platform area in question with an extra emphasis on conciseness. Think of traffic signs. |
| "_Build dynamic audiences in minutes (or less) and deploy personalized customer journeys with our intuitive drag-and-drop interface._" | "_When a user profile is first recognized via the SDK, an ‘anonymous’ user profile is created with an associated `braze_id`: a unique user identifier that is set by Braze. This identifier can be used to delete users through the REST API._" | "_Select at least one Content Test Group or individual user to receive this test message. Messages will be customized with recipients' attributes by default._"                                                                             |

## Product Copy Principles

Principles are the high-level goals we’re hoping to achieve with product copy. These help establish the “tone” of product copy.

<HeaderRow>
  <HeaderItem title="Empower">
    Give readers the tools they need to use the Braze platform by using language
    that informs them and leaves them feeling confident in their ability to use
    our products.
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Educate">
    Give readers the information that they need in the immediate.
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Guide">
    Help your readers navigate the platform in a way that’s informative and
    friendly.
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Respect">
    Meet readers where they are and assume best intent. Put yourselves in their
    position and communicate appropriately. Be inclusive and considerate of
    their time and effort.
  </HeaderItem>
</HeaderRow>

<LeftSideDesc
  title="Empower"
  subtitle="Here we anticipate the question “can I add campaigns to this report after it’s created?” to **empower** users in their decision making."
>
  <img src="/content-strategy/Empower.png" alt="Empower example screenshot" />
</LeftSideDesc>

<LeftSideDesc
  title="Educate"
  subtitle="Here we use placeholder copy to **educate** users on examples of acceptable form inputs."
>
  <img src="/content-strategy/Educate.png" alt="Educate example screenshot" />
</LeftSideDesc>

<LeftSideDesc
  title="Guide"
  subtitle="Here we use an empty state to **guide** users to create a Global Control Group—a prerequisite to viewing this report."
>
  <img src="/content-strategy/Guide.png" alt="Guide example screenshot" />
</LeftSideDesc>

<LeftSideDesc
  title="Respect"
  subtitle="Here we give the user a heads up that this action might not work as expected with their current user count, but **respect** their decision to create it anyways."

  <img src="/content-strategy/Respect.png" alt="Respect example screenshot" />
</LeftSideDesc>

## Guidelines

Guidelines are the boxes to check off when writing any product copy. If a piece of copy adheres to the following guidelines, it will help achieve our goals:

<HeaderRow>
  <HeaderItem title="Clear">
    Use simple words and sentences to communicate the topic you’re writing
    about. Avoid jargon and excessive use of acronyms.
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Concise">
    Keep your writing short and sweet. Try and use as small an amount of words
    as you can to get your point across.
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Useful">
    Make sure you know what the purpose of your content is before writing. What
    problem are you trying to solve and how does this content help?
  </HeaderItem>
  <HeaderItem title="Human">
    Talk to the user like a human. Try and strike an optimistic and
    conversational tone—imagine yourself explaining something to a friend. The
    only exceptions are for error messages and financial transactions.
  </HeaderItem>
