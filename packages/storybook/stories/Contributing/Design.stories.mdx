# Contributing to Design at Beacon

When designing a new component, there are a few areas to consider.

### Component Name

Keep it short and recognizable. Look into the naming patterns used in the industry.

### States and Behavior

States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element.
Make sure youâ€™re taking into account any applicable states. Check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10XDI10BLe-VWARIzirvxIh3WczB3be36MV_OWDEM6iY/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Component Documentation Template</a>
to see the complete list.

Other things to consider if applicable:

- How does this component appear?
- Can this be dismissed or removed, how?
- Can this expand, how?
- Does the component scroll with the page, off the page, or remain sticky?
- Can you scroll content within?
- Will the component trigger feedback once it has been interacted, how?
- What is the appropriate mouse cursor to use based on the event or state of the component?|

### Variants and Properties

Some components may require additional properties like sizing or color variations to name a few in order to
have more flexibility. Keep in mind the primary use cases the product needs in order to decide what needs to be supported.

### Responsiveness

Consider or showcase how a component scales in various viewports

### Accessibility

In order to build our product for the widest audience possible,
incorporate <LinkTo kind="welcome-accessibility-a11y-best-practices--page">a11y best practices</LinkTo> when appropriate.

Example of things to keep in mind when designing:

- Colors
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Do not rely on color alone to convey information
- Typography
- Allow ample spacing around texts to make them easy to distinguish and read
- Longer lines of text can be hard to follow and make readers lose their place in the text, so aim for shorter lines
  - _TBD: Need to define what the suggested text length is for both English and Japanese characters_
- Do not justify text to both the right and left because it creates gaps and uneven spacing.
- See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Rivers of White."</a>

Example of things to keep in mind when developing:

- Using proper and well-structured HTML semantics so the application is understandable and usable with CSS disabled (or when read by screen readers)
  - _TIP: Use the built-in screen reader "VoiceOver" for Mac OS X to test your component's accessibility_
- Any text in ALL CAPS should be typed in its proper casing and capitalization should be achieved using CSS
- All non-text content such as photo, icons, illustrations, and so on, need to have alternative text
- All component functionality should be accessible by keyboard

### Design tokens

Leverage existing <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5aPJgeJi365Xunlps00NbE/2-UI-Component-Library?node-id=2010%3A144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design tokens</a>
when designing the components. Should you need to propose a new design token, make
sure they can be used across multiple use cases a handful of times

### Internationalization

Make sure the component works properly across various locales supported by Braze.

#### Example of things to keep in mind when designing

Keep copy short and succinct as character counts or length of the string can impact component layouts when translated
When designing complex components, make sure to allow enough space for longer translations to avoid text being cut off

#### Example of things to keep in mind when developing

- Using typography like `[this]` or `+` to express emphasis or iconography. Instead, use graphical icons with aria attributes
  for icons, and surround visually emphasized text with html tags with aria attributes styled with CSS to visually indicate emphasis.
  Some of this overlaps with accessibility.
- Interspersing interactive form elements inside sentences, or other design that locks visual elements to English grammar.
- If the component represents dynamic lists, ensure the list is visually separate from other textual elements. Translating
  sentences with dynamic lists is dramatically more complex.

### Usage Guidelines

In order for Beacon users to learn how best to apply components to their specific use case, bringing in context through
documentation is vital.

For designers, use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10XDI10BLe-VWARIzirvxIh3WczB3be36MV_OWDEM6iY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a>
to showcase decisions and recommendations.
