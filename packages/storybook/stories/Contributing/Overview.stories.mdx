## Contribution Criteria

To ensure Beacon continues to be purposefully suited to best help our product scale, and serve our teams to create great user experiences with consistency and efficiency, we created a criteria that new components, patterns, or workflows need to embody.

<br />

### Criteria to consider when proposing a component, pattern, or workflow

- **Uniqueness** Does not replicate components already in our design system
- **Reusability** Solves common user needs that can be used in many instances
- **Agnostic to the Product** Self-contained and does not rely on specific business logic
- **Evidence-based** Proven through user research or data that this is a common unmet need

<br />

### Criteria we consider when creating a component, pattern, or workflow

Once we have agreed on the need for a new component, pattern, or workflow, we have a secondary quality criteria that we use to assess as we create.

- **Intentionally Flexible** Component flexibility considers and addresses its multiple use cases
- **Composable** Where applicable, it can be combined to create new components
- **Solving the Right Problem** The identified need for the component is an appropriate solution to the problem being solved while still being
  flexible and extensible
- **Accessible** - Is usable, accessible, and follows W3C standards, and is inclusive to as many people as possible
- **Appropriate to level of maturity** Takes the design system in a useful direction we are ready for
