# Component Styling

One of the ultimate goals of Beacon is to to create an environment for application development that seldom relies on custom styling. To enable
this, we need to make sure that not only do the Beacon components are styled according to brand and design guidelines, but that they also
interoperate in a way that minimizes the need for additional styling on the part of the end user.

To take full advantage of the power of JavaScript and SASS-like CSS, Beacon uses the `styled-components` library.

## `styled-components`

The approach of `styled-components` is known as 'CSS-in-JS'. As the name suggests, there is some form of runtime evaluation to actually provide
styling to your elements - and you can join any arbitrary logic with your styling.

The main advantage of `styled-components` is that it eliminates the indirection of using DOM classes for styling only. In other words, you can
write styles that are driven by _props_, as demonstrated below.

Another important benefit of styled-components is that it automatically creates vendor prefixing for style attributes wherever necessary. For
instance, writing:

```css
display: inline-flex;
```

gets transpiled to:

```css
display: -webkit-inline-box;
display: -webkit-inline-flex;
display: -ms-inline-flexbox;
display: inline-flex;
```

For these reasons and more, `styled-components` is the preferred method of styling components in Beacon and should be the preferred method for
applications that use Beacon.

### Basic mechanics

`styled-components`' API uses [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#styled) to write SASS-like CSS. The two
primary exports are `styled` and `css`. These, respectively, return a base React element and encapsulate arbitrary styling that can be reused:

```js
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

const border = css`
  border: 1px solid black;
`;

export const StyledContainer = styled.div`
  margin: 0.5rem 0;

  /* tagged templates let you specify functions where you have access to components' props */
  padding: ${(props) => (props.hasInset ? "5px" : 0)};

  /* you can include css snippets in this way */
  ${(props) => props.hasBorder && border};
`;
```

And in your component file:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => (
  <StyledContainer hasInset hasBorder={false}>
    Lorem Ipsum Componentum Examplum
  </StyledContainer>
);
```

### Referencing other `styled-components`

As you build more and more complex components, it is likely and encouraged that you will reuse existing components to put them together. 
While you should always build components with composability and interoperability in mind, it is possible that certain component 
combinations require specific styling adjustments.

One way of doing this is by simply extending another component when building your new `styled-component`, like so:

```tsx
import Component from "../Component";

const MyDerivedComponent = styled(Component)`
  position: absolute;
`;
```

Alternatively, if the component you're creating _contains_ the `styled-component` you want to reference, you can also do the following:

```tsx
import { StyledComponent } from "../Component";

const MyContainerComponent = styled.div`
  ${StyledComponent} {
    position: absolute;
  }
`;
```

Note above that the component being referenced this way must be the `styled-component` export, NOT the main component that uses it. 
This is a common gotcha among beginners of `styled-components`.

### Theme / styling tokens

Styling tokens are basic key-value pairs that drive the product system. They are defined within the [`theme` library](../packages/theme/README.md) and handled via the [`styling` library](../packages/styling/README.md) functions. The theme is meant to be imported into the `styled-component`s wherever applicable. Please seek guidance from your design partner about what these key-value pairs should be.

For instance, a `styled-component` using our theme may look like this:

```js
import { getBorderWidth, getColor } from "@braze/beacon-styling";

const borderCSS = css`
  border: ${getBorderWidth("thin")} solid ${getColor("gray", 900)};
`;
```

### Organization

Every component that has its own styles has a nested `StyledComponent` directory that accompanies it (this directory and its contents 
are produced by the [scaffolding tool](https://beacon-storybook.braze.com/?path=/story/welcome-contributing-contributing-code--page#creating-a-new-component)). 
This is where all styling information should reside.

## About the other approaches to styling

While `styled-components` is the preferred method for styling components, there are alternatives that may be used sparingly for 
escape-hatch situations or simple style overrides where creating an entirely new `styled-component` may create undesirable overhead.

### Inline

It is entirely possible to not write a single line of CSS in routine React development using inline styles. If you _do_ wish to 
use them however, you may note that all DOM-level React elements have a `style` prop, which let you do things like:

```tsx
const ColorfulText = ({ color, children }) => (
  <p style={{ fontColor: color }}>{children}</p>
);
```

You will notice that a `style` prop is an object keyed by strings corresponding to object-safe tokens (think `fontColor` instead 
of `font-color`) and whose values are also strings. Although this works, it does not allow you to take advantage of the other 
features of CSS, like state pseudoselectors, animations, cascades, vendor prefixing, etc.

Note that `style` props can also be used with `styled-components` for inline overrides, should the need arise.

Although there is a place for inline styling, this is not desirable in much the same way that you would not prefer writing inline 
styles in HTML.

### External CSS/LESS

In a platonic form of CSS, styles are contained in well-named classes that are organized for minimal conflict and high specificity. 
Taking this approach, any visual changes to a component are brokered through the addition and removal of `className`s, like:

```tsx
const Select = ({ options, disabled }) => (
  <ul className={`bcl-Select ${disabled ? "bcl-Select__disabled" : ""}`}>
    {/* snip */}
  </ul>
);
```

and in the resulting less file:

```less
.bcl-Select {
  &.bcl-Select__disabled {
    color: gray;
    cursor: not-allowed;
  }
}
```

This is sufficient, and given a build process, outputs some built CSS that you will need to include in your web application's `<head>`. 
Consequently your job now includes maintaining `className`s and ensuring cascades and class conventions are correct. To that end, 
custom CSS/LESS files should generally be avoided in favor of `styled-component` implementations.
