# useId Hook

The useId hook is used to auto-generate ids for an element that is not provided as a prop.
The id will remain consistent the entire time that the calling component remains mounted,
but if the component unmounded and remounted, then there will be a new id.
You can pass in a prefix to make the id easier to human identify, and reduce the chance of collision.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Portal` component.

### Basic use

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-hooks-useid--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### no prefix

It is recommended to always use a prefix when generating an id. However, you can generate an id without a prefix by not passing a parameter to useId().

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-hooks-useid--no-prefix" />
</Canvas>
