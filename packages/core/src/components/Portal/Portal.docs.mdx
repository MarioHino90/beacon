# Portal

Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that
exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

> Note: if you wish to portal your children into a specific div not at the
> bottom of the page, use `React.createPortal` directly

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Portal` component.

### Basic use

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-portal--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Unmounting

You can unmount the Portal and it's children by just removing it from the render tree,
like any other React component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-portal--unmount" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

```javascript
import { Portal } from "@braze/beacon-core";
```
