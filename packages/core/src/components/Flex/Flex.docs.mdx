# Flex

`Flex` component renders a one-dimensional layout component with
`display: flex` and related attributes for convenient access and
vendor prefixing out of the box.

Note that if the children of the `Flex` component need to specify
their own flex attributes, such as `flex: 1`, it is up to those
components to do so-- `Flex` will not manage these attributes.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Flex` component.

### Basic use

A `Flex` component provides an easy way to provide powerful layout
options to your pages via the `display: flex` CSS attribute. Used
with no props, it simply defines a flexbox.

  <Story id="core-layout-flex--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Justify content

The `Flex` component supports adjusting content distribution along the
main axis via the `justifyContent` prop, which is mapped to the
`justify-content` CSS attribute. See `knobs` in the `Canvas` tab to
see the effect of the various values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--justify-content" />
</Canvas>

### Align items

The `Flex` component supports adjusting content distribution along the
cross axis via the `alignItems` prop, which is mapped to the
`align-items` CSS attribute. See `knobs` in the `Canvas` tab to
see the effect of the various values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--align-items" />
</Canvas>

### Direction

The `Flex` component supports adjusting the direction of the main axis
via the `direction` prop, which is mapped to the `flex-direction`
CSS attribute. See `knobs` in the `Canvas` tab to see the effect of the
various values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--direction" />
</Canvas>

### Inline flex

By default, the `display: flex` attribute behaves like as a `block` scoped
element. You can override this behavior and make it inline by setting the
`inline` prop to true, which will set the CSS attribute to `display: inline-flex`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--inline" />
</Canvas>

### Text alignment

The `Flex` component supports adjusting the alignment of the text content
via the `textAlign` prop, which is mapped to the `text-align`
CSS attribute. See `knobs` in the `Canvas` tab to see the effect of the
various values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--text-alignment" />
</Canvas>

### Wrap

The `Flex` component supports adjusting the wrapping behavior of its
content via the `wrap` prop, which is mapped to the `flex-wrap`
CSS attribute. See `knobs` in the `Canvas` tab to see the effect of the
various values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--wrap" />
</Canvas>

### All together

Of course, multiple props can be combined together to create complex layouts.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flex--combined-props" />
</Canvas>

### invalid custom styles

Flex supports the `stlye` attribute that common to all html componets, and this style gets applied to the flex container.
However, if you need to apply a margin or padding please use the `FlexBox` component instead.
If you attempt to set margin or padding of a `Flex`, there will be a warning in the browser console (on your local environment only).
