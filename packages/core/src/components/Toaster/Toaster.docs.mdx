# Toaster

The `Toaster` component is used to display "notification"-like alert messages
that are added on top of the main content, with the goal of not displacing the
primary page content and avoiding being too disruptive.

Since individual `Toast`s are short-lived and may happen with high frequency,
the `Toaster` component also exposes a `makeToast` function that automatically
creates new `Toasts` rather than requiring the user to keep track of their
rendering as React components directly.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Toaster` component.

> NOTE: Because of the way Storybook renders stories, a more representative
> use of the `Toaster` component can be seen via the `Canvas` tab.

### Basic use

To use the `Toaster`, simply place it somewhere near the root of your React
tree. Once that is available, you can then use the `makeToast` function to
display individual toasts programmatically within your app. Click the
`Make toast` button in the story below to see how it works in practice.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### With no auto-close

If you need toasts to remain open until the user dismisses them, you can
turn off auto-close functionality by setting `autoClose` to `false`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--no-auto-close" />
</Canvas>

### With onClick

Toasts support click behavior via the `options` object passed as the last
argument of the `makeToast` function. As shown in the story below, you can
add an `onClick` listener in `Toasts` to listen to when a user clicks into
it and perform an action.

See the Properties section below for more info on the usage of the
`makeToast` function.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--with-onclick" />
</Canvas>

### With link

Toasts also supports `Link`s inside a toast when the user
should be redirected to a different page upon clicking.
Any links must use the `Link` component exported from
`@braze/beacon-core` to correctly get the visual
styles within the `Toast`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--with-link" />
</Canvas>

### With quaternary button

Toasts also supports `Button`s inside a toast when the user
can perform an action by clicking on the `Button` in the
`Toast`. Any buttons must use the `Button` component exported
from `@braze/beacon-core` with the `quaternary` prop to correctly
get the visual styles within the `Toast`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--with-quaternary-button" />
</Canvas>

### With programmatic dismissal

In certain cases, we may not want the toast to automatically
close itself after a certian period and only allow it to be
dismissed programmatically (e.g. loading state). The example
below shows how this can be achieved with the use of `dismissToast`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-alerts-toaster--with-programmatic-dismissal" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

```javascript
import { Toaster, makeToast } from "@braze/beacon-core";
```

| `id`        | string   | -            | -          | id to be passed to the DOM                                                       |
| `autoClose` | number   | -            | -          | number of seconds to wait before automatically closing the Toast; in miliseconds |
| `limit`     | number   | 3            | -          | Limit the number of toast displayed at the same time                             |

### `makeToast`

Creates and immediately displays a new `Toast` component on invocation. A `Toaster`
component _MUST_ already be rendered on the page for this function to work properly.

- `intent`: required; must be one of `danger`, `info`, `success`, or `warning`
- `content`: required; can be a string or a React component
- `options`: optional; an object that can contain any of the following props:
  - `onClick`: called when the `Toast` is clicked on
  - `onOpen`: called when the notification appears
  - `onClose`: called when the notification appears
  - `toastId`: sets a custom id for the `Toast` rendered
  - `containerId`: container to render `Toast` inside
  - `autoClose`: indicates whether the toast should close automatically after a defined period of time (`number` in ms); `false` if toast should only close programmatically

Example usage:

```ts
const handleClick = () => {
  makeToast("info", "Your request has been received.");
};
```

Example usage 2:

```tsx
const handleClick = () => {
  makeToast(
    "info",
    <span>
      Your request has been received. <a>Click me</a>
    </span>
  );
};
```

Example usage 3:

```tsx
const handleClick = () => {
  makeToast("info", <span>Your request has been received.</span>, {
    onClick: () => history.push("/request-statuses"),
  });
};
```

### `dismissToast`

Dismisses either one or all currently displayed `Toast`s. This behavior
is controlled by whether or not the function is called with a `toastId`
returned by `makeToast`.

Example usage 1:

```tsx
const toastId = useRef<string | number | null>(null);

const handleToast = () => {
  toastId.current = makeToast(
    "info",
    <span>Your request has been received.</span>,
    {
      onClick: () => history.push("/request-statuses"),
    }
  );
};

const handleDismiss = () => {
  if (toastId.current) {
    dismissToast(toastId);

    toastId.current = null;
  }
};
```

Example usage 2:

```tsx
const handleToast = () => {
  makeToast("info", <span>Your request has been received.</span>, {
    onClick: () => history.push("/request-statuses"),
  });
};

const handleDismissAllToasts = () => {
  dismissToast();
};
```
