# Popper

This story exists to document advanced behavior. In most cases, as a developer, you want to look at `Tooltip`, `Popover`, or `UncontrolledTooltip`.
Proceed if you are writing a new component that uses `Popper` directly.

> NOTE: The `Popper` component has a `30vh` max-height by default, which
> is to encourage limiting the amount of content placed in `Popper`s.

## Advanced Examples

These examples should be ignored for end user developers, unless implementing a new component that needs to
interact with the underlying Popper in more unusual ways.

### Rendering later, using Context to set the data used to render elements

In some cases, it is not known at initial render time what elements will be present that need tooltips.
The underlying Popper element that forms the internal implementation of ToolTip supports this use case.

Here is an example source code that demonstrates using React Context and a callback to construct the child
elements to support a more intuitive developer interface:

```tsx
export const SampleContext = createContext({ addButton: () => {} });

export const RenderTooltipButton = ({ children }) => {
  const { addButton } = useContext(SampleContext);
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // add a parent button with custom tooltip
    addButton(children);
  }, [addButton, children]);
  return null;
};

export const DelayedRenderOfChildrenwithTooltips = ({ children }) => {
  const [buttons, setButtons] = useState(new Set());
  // useCallback to prevent infinite re-render
  const addButton = useCallback((buttonText) => {
    setButtons((oldState) => new Set([...oldState, buttonText])), [setButtons];
  });
  return (
    <SampleContext.Provider value={{ addButton }}>
      <div>
        {[...buttons].map((toolTip) => (
          <span key={toolTip}>
            <UncontrolledTooltip label={toolTip}>
              <Button>Hover over me</Button>
            </UncontrolledTooltip>
            &nbsp;
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
      {children}
    </SampleContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Overriding the default height

For some use cases, such as the Popper used inside Beacon's `DatePicker`,
it is necessary to override the max height and max width.

### Prevent close on outside click for specified elements with class

Sometimes, you may want your `Popper` to _not_ close when a user clicks on
specific elements. To denote elements that should not cause your `Popper`
to close, either give them the a `className` of `bcl-popper-ignore-click`
or whatever className corresponds to the `ignoreCloseOnClickOutsideClassName`
prop you provide your `Popper` component.

</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-popper--prevent-close-on-outside-click-for-element-with-custom-class" />
</Canvas>

To completely disable closing the popper except by clicking on the target, pass `false`
to the `closeOnClickOutside` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-popper--prevent-close-on-any-outside-interaction" />
</Canvas>

While this should rarely be needed, if you want to completely disable the
outside click behavior for performance reasons or to prevent unintentional
behavior, you can set `isIgnoreCloseOnClickOutsideEnabled` to `false`.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popper--no-crash-on-outside-click-for-element-with-empty-ignore-class" />
</Canvas>

### Rendering a popper with internal interactive elements

When the popper contains elements that users can interact with, such as a form or a link to open external documentation, the
`interactive` prop should be true to prevent the popper closing on interacting with its internal elements

  <Story id="core-overlay-popper--interactive" />
</Canvas>

### Delaying opening the popper

In some cases (such as for tooltips), it may be desirable to delay opening the popper by a set amount.
Note that if `delay` is specified, `untriggers` is a required property to get the desired behavior.
Otherwise, the popup will disappear immediately.
