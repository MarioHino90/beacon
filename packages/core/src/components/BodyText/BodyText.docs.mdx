# BodyText

<Meta title="Core/Text/BodyText" component={BodyText} />

The `BodyText` component is built using the typography tokens.
Prefer using this component when incorporating undecorated text
elements into components or your application rather than
referencing typography tokens in your styles.

## Use cases

See below for some sample use cases on how the `BodyText` component
can be used in different ways.

### Default Case

Body text is represented by a `BodyText` component. These
come in medium and small sizes. Labels for form components use a
special size as well.

> Go to the canvas tab to interact with the font family, size and
> variants.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-text-bodytext--default-case" />
