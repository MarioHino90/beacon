# Box

The `Box` component is a base-level component you to create visual sections with
helpful styling tools attached. It can do things like calculate spacing and
setting styling.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Box` component.

### Basic use

Often, a section of the DOM has margin and padding applied to it. The `Box`
component can set these css properties for all 4 dimensions when passed a
spacing option.

The teal border shows the margin. The rose border shows the padding.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Multiple Sizes

The `Box` component can also set each of the 4 dimensions seperately.

The teal border shows the margin. The rose border shows the padding.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--multiple-sizes" />
</Canvas>

### Convenience Sizes

The `Box` component provides `horizontal` and `vertical` sizing props.
`horizontal` will set the left and right dimensions. `vertical` will set the top
and bottom dimensions.

The teal border shows the margin. The rose border shows the padding.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--convenience-sizes" />
</Canvas>

### Inline

The `Box` component can be made to display using the `inline-block`
attribute by passing it an `inline={true}` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--inline" />
</Canvas>

### Other Styling

The `Box` component can apply other styles along with spacing. Below is an
example showing how to apply flexbox.

The teal border shows the margin. The rose border shows the padding. The green
border shows the children's borders.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--other-styling" />
</Canvas>

### Spacing Without Box

While it is encouraged to use the `Box` component, if spacing needs to be
applied to other components the `getBoxCss` function has been made available
for use.

The `getBoxCss` takes the same types as `Box` for margin and padding.

The teal border shows the margin. The rose border shows the padding.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--spacing-without-box" />
</Canvas>

### As another element type

The `Box` component can be configured to render any other valid React
component or HTML element via the `as` prop. This is especially useful
when you want a semantically correct container.

Note below that the box is being rendered as a `section` instead of the
default `div`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-box--as-another-element" />
</Canvas>

Note also that `div`s are rendered as `display: block` elements by
default, therefore changing the underlying element to something that
does not render the same way may change the appearance of your
container. In such scenarios, you may need to wrap your desired
component with a `Box` instead, as shown in earlier stories on this page.

See below a `Box` rendered using `span` as its `as` prop:

```tsx
<div
  className="wrapper-display"
  style={{
    display: "inline-block",
    border: "1px solid",
    borderColor: getColor("lightBlue", 500)({ theme }),
  }}
>
  <Box
    boxMargin="md"
    boxPadding="xl"
    style={{
      border: "1px solid",
      borderColor: getColor("red", 500)({ theme }),
    }}
    as="span"
  >
    <BodyText>I need spacing!</BodyText>
  </Box>
</div>
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Box } from "@braze/beacon-core";
import { getBoxCss } from "@braze/beacon-core";
```

## Types

These type definitions are needed to understand the property types.

#### SpacingOptions

```typescript
type SpacingOptions =
  | "none"
  | "xs"
  | "sm"
  | "md"
  | "lg"
  | "xl"
  | "xxl"
  | "xxxl";
```

#### BoxSpecs

```typescript
interface BoxSpecs {
  left?: SpacingOptions;
  right?: SpacingOptions;
  top?: SpacingOptions;
  bottom?: SpacingOptions;
  vertical?: SpacingOptions;
  horizontal?: SpacingOptions;
}
```
