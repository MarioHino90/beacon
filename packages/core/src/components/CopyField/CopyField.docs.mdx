# CopyField

`CopyField` is an input element containing blocks of reusable
code that can be inserted in a code file. They are always
accompanied by a copy button.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `CopyField` component.

### Basic use

The `CopyField` component enables users to select and easily
copy a snippet of code or text to their keyboard, as shown
below. Test it out by clicking "Copy" and then paste your
clipboard in the input field immediately below.

> TIP: Check out the canvas tab to see a few knobs that allow
> you to customize the experience.

### With no text in button

To make your `CopyField` more compact, you can flip the
`showTextInButton` prop to `false`.

  <Story id="core-forms-copyfield--with-no-text-in-button" />

### With different sizes

`CopyField` supports the same sizes as the regular `Input`
component it's based on!

### With different copy text

To provide more specific information to your user, you can
override the tooltip text to render different text via the
`copyTooltipText` prop.
