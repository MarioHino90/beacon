# Modal

The `Modal` component is used to provide additional context and/or prompt
the user to take some sort of action. The goal is to avoid taking the user
to a different screen, especially if the actions done by the modal are
destructive.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Modal` component.

> NOTE: to align the `Button` components left and right, you can use the
> `ModalFooter` in `aligner` mode as shown in the examples below.

### Size: small (w/o icon)

Small modals are used for short communications that may need user input.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--size-small-wo-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Size: small (w/ icon)

When appropriate a small modal can have an icon. To pass one, specify
the `iconType` prop in `ModalHeading`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--size-small-w-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Size: medium

Medium modals are the most common modal size in the dashboard.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--size-medium" />
</Canvas>

### Size: large

Large modals are used to display large and complex content. They should be
used sparingly and very intentionally.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--size-large" />
</Canvas>

### Size: extra large

Use the extra large modal **only when** the content doesn't fit in
`size === 'lg'`. Before using `extra large`, ask yourself:

- Should this be a new page instead?
- Am I trying to put too much content inside a Modal?
- When was the last time I went on [ModalzModalzModalz](https://modalzmodalzmodalz.com/)?

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--size-extra-large" />
</Canvas>

### Heading size with h3

You can also modify the size of the `ModalHeading` using the `level`
prop, much like you would a standalone `Heading` component. By default,
`ModalHeading` has a level of `2`.

> Tip: Go over to the `Canvas` tab and play with the knobs to see
> how the `ModalHeading` in `h3` format might work in different `Modal`
> sizes.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--heading-size-with-h-3" />
</Canvas>

### Nested Modals

To nest modals, simply render a modal as a child of another modal. The z-indexing
will be automatically calculated.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--nested-modals" />
</Canvas>

### Nested Modals with Custom Z-Index

To nest modals, simply render a modal as a child of another modal. The z-indexing
will be automatically calculated even with a custom z-index passed to the parent
modal.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--nested-modals-with-custom-z-index" />
</Canvas>

### Non-dismissable Modal

`Modal`s are not dismissable if `toggle` is not passed to the `Modal`. This will
prevent closing from clicking outside of the `Modal`, as well remove any automatic
closing components (such as the close button). You can still add a components that
dismiss the `Modal` manually.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--non-dismissable-modal" />
</Canvas>

#### Non-dismissable Modal with No exit button

The exit `Button` on a non-dismissable `Modal` is completely optional. This can
be used to block user interaction if needed.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--non-dismissable-modal-with-no-exit" />
</Canvas>

### Modal with Outside Content

`Modal`s often have poppers and other content that is inside the `Modal`, but in another
`Portal`. You can use the `bcl-ignore-click-outside` class to have the `Modal` not
close.

Clicking on the pink "Click Me" square in the example below will NOT close the
`Modal`.

To view this effect, view the story in "Canvas" view (this is "Docs" view).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--modal-with-outside-content" />
</Canvas>

#### Modal with Beacon Popovers/Tooltips

You can see some examples of using our pre-built `Tooltip`s and `Popover`s with
the `Modal` below.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-modal--modal-with-popovers" />
</Canvas>

import {
  Modal,
