# Button

A `Button` allows the user to make things happen.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Button` component.

### Basic use

Try clicking! You can also show icons with text by passing it the
icon as a child.

> Go to the canvas tab to interact with the `disabled`, `intent`,
> `muted`, `variant`, and `size` props!

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-button--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Primary variant

The most typical use case of the `Button`, the `primary`
variant indicates that the `Button` has highest relative importance
and/or impact relative to other `Button` variants.

> Tip: try clicking into the box below and tabbing through the
> `Button`s to see their focus state!

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-button--primary-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary variant

The `secondary` variant usually indicates a contrast to the `primary`
but is not the intended focus of the user's attention. A common use
case is in `Modal` dialogs where there's a `Keep editing` action as
a contrast to the primary, which might be `Save and close`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-button--secondary-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Tertiary variant

The `tertiary` variant is the `Button` that is meant to draw
the least attention relative to other button variants. A common
use case often involves effects that may be destructive.

For example, in `Modal` dialogs where there's a `Save and close`
`Button` as the `primary`, and a `Keep going` `Button` as the secondary,
a `tertiary` `Button` may say `Don't save and close`.

> NOTE: The `tertiary` variant is being considered for deprecation
> and may be replaced by the `quaternary` variant (below) in the near
> future. If you have use cases that require ongoing support for the
> `tertiary` variant, please inform the DASHI team at your earliest
> convenience.

  <Story id="core-primitives-button--tertiary-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Quaternary variant

The `quaternary` variant is the `Button` that is meant to
behave more like a link than a `Button` and has a much
smaller profile. A common use case often involves including
it among text or with actions that may be destructive.

For example, in `Modal` dialogs where there's a `Save and close`
`Button` as the `primary`, and a `Keep going` `Button` as the
`secondary`, a `quaternary` `Button` may say `Don't save and close`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-button--quaternary-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Different sizes

Depending on the layout of your application, you may need to use
differently sized `Button` components. The following illustrate
the available sizing options.

> Tip: go to the `canvas` tab to change how the different sizes
> appear in different prop configurations.

### Disabled use

<BannerAlert isOpen intent="warning">
  <BannerAlertBody>
    <BannerAlertDescription>
      <BannerAlertDescriptionText>
        When using a <code>ref</code> with a <code>Button</code>, it will attach to the
        button, unless it is disabled. Disabled buttons cannot be used to trigger tooltips or
        annotations. To work around this, when the button is disabled, the entire thing is wrapped in
        a <code>div</code> element, and the ref is attached to this instead. If the ref is being used
        to trigger the button action, or any other button-specific interaction, it is important that
        the button cannot be disabled, or that the code referencing the ref prevent attempting to
        interact with the button when it is disabled.

    </BannerAlertDescription>
  </BannerAlertBody>
</BannerAlert>

If you need to prevent the user from being able to take any
action (e.g. because they need to fill out all the required fields
in a form before submitting), you can disable the `Button` entirely
using the `disabled` prop.

When disabled, the `Button` will NOT call the `onClick` function upon
user click.

  <Story id="core-primitives-button--disabled-use" />
</Canvas>

Using tooltips or annotations on disabled buttons is directly supported as well

  <Story id="core-primitives-button--disabled-with-tooltip" />
</Canvas>

### Loading state (w/ success)

Clicking a `Button` may sometimes trigger an async action that can take
some time to complete. In such cases, you can set the `loadingState` prop
to `loading` to indicate that the `Button` is currently loading. Note that
the button will automatically be disabled when `loadingState` is `loading`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-button--loading-state-w-success" />
</Canvas>

### Loading state (w/ error)

Occasionally, the async action created by the button may result in an
error. In such cases, you can set the `loadingState` to `error` to
denote the failure.

By default, an error state will NOT be reset automatically to the
default button state. If you want to modify this behavior, you can pass
an `options` object with `resetOnError: true` as the second argument
of the `useLoadingButton` hook.

To get out of the error state, a second element of the `useLoadingButton`
return is an `onReset` callback that can be called to imperatively reset
state.

> NOTE: It's recommended that you supplement this with information on
> how to resolve the error, so that the user can remedy the issue.

\*: by default, the aria-label of `Button` is set to "Button click success" or "Button click error"
(localized via the `@braze/beacon-translations` package) for "success" and "error" loading states, resp.

### `useLoadingButton`

This hook is used to handle loading state management for a `Button`.

> NOTE: A separate `useLoadingButton` hook call should be used for each button.

- `status`: required; must be one of `idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`
- `options`: optional; must be an object that can have any combination of the following key:value pairs:
  - `ref`: if you want to pass your own `ref` into the `Button`, pass it here instead of into the `Button` directly
  - `timeout`: miliseconds after which the `Button` state will reset to `idle`; default is `3000`
  - `resetOnError`: indicates that the loading state of the `Button` should be reset to `idle` after `timeout`; default: `false`

Returns an array with two elements:

- Props to be passed directly into the button, including the following (see `Button` properties for details):
  - `loadingState`
  - `minWidth`
  - `ref`
- A reset callback that resets the hook's loading state to `idle`
