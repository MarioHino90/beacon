# RadioButton

A radio is a form of control allowing users to pick a single option
from the group. All possible options are exposed upfront for users
to compare.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `RadioButton` component.

> Note: for use cases involving multiple `RadioButtons` used together,
> please refer to the `RadioButtonGroup` stories.

### Basic use

It is important to note that the `checked` and `defaultChecked` props
are only used with isolated `RadioButton`s. When using in the context
of a `RadioButtonGroup`, the `value` of the `RadioButtonGroup` controls
the individual `RadioButton`'s `checked` prop. See the `RadioButtonGroup`
stories for examples there.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-forms-radiobutton--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### With children

Rather than using the `label` prop, you can also pass in content as
children to render a label. Note that when both `children` and `label`
props are present, only `children` will be rendered.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-forms-radiobutton--with-children" />
</Canvas>

### With help text

`RadioButton` can also be used with a help text underneath,
informing the user about the consequences of their selection.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-forms-radiobutton--with-help-text" />
</Canvas>

### Invalid entry

Most commonly, a radio button may be displayed as `invalid` if
a user fails to make selection when prompted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-forms-radiobutton--invalid-entry" />
</Canvas>

## Controlling the radio button state programmatically

Controlling the radio button's checked state via external state is also possible.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-forms-radiobutton--update-programmatically-later" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

```javascript
import { RadioButton } from "@braze/beacon-core";
```
