# Switch

The `Switch` component acts as a stylized "checkbox", and is intended for use
cases such as user setting toggles.

**Note:** The `Switch` and `SimpleSwitch` components are not intended for use
in forms. Use a `Checkbox` component instead.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Switch` component.

### Basic use

A `Switch` component that toggles between "on" and "off". Using the `label` prop,
you can define both the label visually displayed to the user as well as the
`aria-label` value for the container.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-switch--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled use

A `Switch` component can be disabled using the `disabled` prop
to prevent user from making changes but still visually reflect
the current state of the underlying `Switch`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-switch--disabled-use" />
</Canvas>

### Use with children

Below is an example of using the `Switch` component with a custom child rather
than a `label` string.

> **Note:** In such cases, the `aria-label` should always be included for
> accessibilty reasons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-switch--use-with-children" />
</Canvas>

### Use without label or children

You can also use a switch without any `label` or `children` prop.

> **Note:** This is NOT recommended for general use, and the `aria-label`
> should always be included for accessibilty reasons.
