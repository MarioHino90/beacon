# Popover

The `Popover` component opens a box that overlays other content to provide
contextual help to a user. `Popover` provides the ability to display
additional contextual information or functionality. It can house various
elements such as header, scrollable content, text links or buttons.
`Popover` can be dismissed via a close icon, clicking the control that
opened it, or by clicking anywhere outside of the popover.

> If you need to provide simple context and/or have no need for
> interactivity, please use the `Tooltip` component instead

> NOTE: The `Popover` component has a `30vh` max-height by default, which
> is to encourage limiting the amount of content placed in `Popover`s.

> WARNING: The `Popover` component should only be used in conjunction with a `button` or `input`
> element. Behavior with other elements is undefined and may not function correctly.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Popover` component.

### Basic use: trigger on click

By default, the `Popover` component is set to open only by clicking on
its target element. If you wish to override this behavior, please read
on for customization options below.

To facilitate usage, we also export a `usePopover` hook that manages
the `Popover`s state for you. Simply invoke the hook, assign it to a
variable, and use the object spread notation in `Popover` to use it,
as shown below!

</Canvas>

### Trigger on focus

By setting the `triggers` prop to `['focus']` and `untriggers` to `['blur']`,
you can make the `Popover` open when the `target` is focused and close
when it is blurred. To test this functionality, we recommend tabbing into
the box rather than clicking on the button to clearly see the behavior on
`focus` and `blur`.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--trigger-on-focus" />
</Canvas>

### Trigger on hover

By setting the `triggers` prop to `['mouseenter', 'mouseleave']`, you
can make the `Popover` open when the `target` is hovered and close when
it is no longer hovered.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--trigger-on-hover" />
</Canvas>

### Use with target DOM id

Depending on your target component, it may not always be possible to use refs
to get access to the DOM node. In such cases, the `target` prop is provided as
an escape hatch. The `target` prop must correspond to the DOM id of the `target`
element. Note that this requires that no two DOM ids are the same.

### Interactive: prevent close when hovering over or clicking into popover

Especially within `Popover`s, it is often useful to allow your user to mouse
over the contents of the `Popover` and interact with them. To enable this
functionality, set the `interactive` prop to `true`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--interactive" />
</Canvas>

### With close button

By setting `isCloseEnabled` prop to `true`, you can ensure that an `X`
button appears, which closes the `Popover` upon clicking.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--with-close-button" />
</Canvas>

### Automatic placement: dynamic positioning of popover

In some cases, it is not known in advance where a popover's target element will be located in the viewport.
Leave placement undefined to trigger auto-positioning.

> Tip: When `Popover` is placed inside a container with overflow, it is recommended that you define an inner
> container with `position: relative;` and pass a ref into it as well as into the `Popover` as `portalRef`. this
> will ensure that the `Popover` is portalled into the container with relative positioning, allowing the `Popover`
> to use the coordinates of its target relative to the `portalRef` parent. See below for example.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--auto-placement" />
</Canvas>

### Modal Use

`Popover` will automatically calculate the z-index needed to display over a
`Modal` it is inside of. Note that the `Modal` z-index is well above the
`Popover`'s base z-index, but the `Popover` still renders above it.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--modal-use" />
</Canvas>

### Prevent close on outside click for specified elements with class

Sometimes, you may want your `Popover` to _not_ close when a user clicks on
specific elements. To denote elements that should not cause your `Popover`
to close, either give them the a `className` of `bcl-popper-ignore-click`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--prevent-close-on-outside-click-for-element-with-class" />
</Canvas>

### Prevent close on outside click for specified elements with custom class

You can also pick your own className by passing a value to the
`ignoreCloseOnClickOutsideClassName` prop for your `Popover` component; this
same className should then be given to your ignored elements as desired.

  <Story id="core-overlay-popover--prevent-close-on-outside-click-for-element-with-custom-class" />
</Canvas>

## Keyboard interactivity and accessibility inside the Popover

When a Popover has interactive content, making it keyboard accessible is very important. Popover will
remain open, detecting when an internal interactive element has focus, and then trigger the close
action when focus tabs out of the popper.

## Usage

```javascript
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverBody,
  PopoverHeading,
  usePopover,
} from "@braze/beacon-core";
```

### `usePopover`

`usePopover` is a utility hook that aims to simplify your life when using
a `Popover` in your project. The function conveniently manages the `Popover`
state and the necessary refs for you, making getting started with a `Popover`
a breeze.

The following are arguments accepted by `usePopover`:

- `targetRef`: `React.RefObject`
  - optional
  - ref object to be passed to both the target component via its `ref` and the `Popover` via its `targetRef`
- `initialState`: `boolean`
  - optional; `false` by default
  - sets the initial state of the `Popover`

`usePopover` returns the an array that can be destructured to reveal the following:

- `state`: `object`
  - exposes the state of the `Popover` and handlers
  - can be passed into the `Popover` via object destructuring (e.g. `{...state}`)
  - contains the following:
    - `isOpen`: boolean; indicates current state of the `Popover`
    - `onOpen`: func; changes `isOpen` to `true` when called
    - `onClose`: func; changes `isOpen` to `false` when called
- `ref`: `React.RefObject`
  - if an argument was passed to `targetRef`, then this is identical to that argument
  - if an argument was NOT passed to `targetRef`, this will be a newly instantiated ref object to be passed to both the target component via its `ref` and the `Popover` via its `targetRef`
