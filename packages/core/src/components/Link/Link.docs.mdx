# Link

The `Link` component is a navigational element that renders an anchor
tag by default. This component should be used primarily for navigation.

Note that the `Link` component also supports an `as` prop to render another
component to the DOM with the same styles, which is particularly useful for
alternative navigational libraries like `react-router-dom`.

## Use cases

Below are some common use cases for the `Link` component.

### Basic use

Without any `variant` prop defined, the `Link` component has basic styles
applied to it and should be used as a primary link that you want your users
to notice/find easily.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-link--basic-use" />
</Canvas>

### Table variant

The table `variant` of the `Link` component has a more subdued style to
minimize visual clutter in an already cluttered space.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-link--table-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Inline variant

Another `variant` of the `Link` component is inline, which is most suitable
for use inside a body of text as opposed to when it exists alone. In this case,
the font size of `Link` will inherit that of its container.

> NOTE: For call to action links, we can pass `isCTA` property to Link component.
> If we add `isCTA` property, the link will not wrap onto multiple lines.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-link--inline-variant" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled use

To indicate that a link is currently inacessible, set the `disabled` link
to true.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-link--disabled-use" />
</Canvas>

### External Links

Setting the `showExternalLinkIcon` property to `true` on the external link which has `target="_blank"` will display an external link icon next to the link text.
Use when the link takes users to a new page outside of the current app.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-primitives-link--external-link" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

```javascript
import { Link } from "@braze/beacon-core";
```
